	 * The example simple PWLE waveform is designed as follows.
	 * S:0 is a placeholder for CS40L26, this value could also be S:1 and would have no effect
	 * as all OWT waveforms are written to RAM. WF:0 marks the effect as a buzz; this is the
	 * information used by other waveforms, and it does not affect the behavior of the designed
	 * PWLE. The entirety of the PWLE will be played twice since one repeat has been assigned
	 * via RP:1. The wait time between repeats will be 399.5 ms (WT:399.5). M:-1 and K:0
	 * indicates that SVC braking will not be in use, and the braking time will be ignored.
	 *
	 * The next symbols are section specific. T0:0 indicates that section 0 starts at 0 ms;
	 * L0:0.49152 gives the intensity level of section 0. This section will play at 200 Hz and
	 * is not designated as a chirp, meaning the frequency will be constant; these parameters
	 * are set with F0:200 and C0:0. Rounding out section 0â€™s parameters, B0:0 indicates that
	 * there is no braking but, as mentioned in the above table, this value has no effect for
	 * CS40L26. R0:0 indicates that no offset be applied to the resonant frequency. Furthermore,
	 * section 0 will not be using amplitude regulation: A0:0, V0:0.
	 *
	 * Section 1 is the final section of the PWLE waveform. The string enables section 1 at
	 * 400 ms (400 ms after section 0 was started) T1:400. The frequency and intensity level
	 * remains the same as the previous section with L1:0.49152, F1:200 and once again there
	 * are no braking or chirp capabilities (C1:0, B1:0); recall that braking has no effect on
	 * CS40L26. Section 1 does have amplitude regulation enabled (AR1:1) and sets a back EMF
	 * voltage target of 0.022 V (V1:0.022).
